Successfully built and ran a one scene project with a main camera, 3D cube and point light - but didn't use Tango.
Error seems to be related to Tango, double check integration with Unity tomorrow

After reading online, error seems to be a dependency or library issue.
Downgraded Unity from 2017.1.0 to 5.6.1 and now the app can build and run.

Now the 3D GameObjects have a cascade effect when moving the camera.
Happens on both the emulator and the phone.

Tried several different versions of Unity, down to 5.2.1 (they used this version in their sample projects on github), cascade effect present in all.
To make Android sdk work with the older versions of Unity:
	http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/1323731/unable-to-list-target-platforms-please-make-sure-t.html

Back to Unity 5.6.0. Tried these tutorials:
	https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/unity/unity-simple-ar
	https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/unity/unity-howto-placing-objects

No cascade effect present with the emulator when "Tango AR Screen" and "AR Camera Post Process" are checked under Tango Camera.
Still present on the phone. Can't find info about this online so asked StackOverflow.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45068186/cascade-effect-with-3d-gameobjects-tango-unity-android/45068793#45068793 (I feel dumb now)
	
Tutorials that work:
	https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/unity/unity-simple-ar
	https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/unity/unity-howto-motion-tracking
	https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/unity/unity-howto-placing-objects (kinda?)

Want to learn more about how to use the camera + the examples on Tango github.

Finished reading paper: "Named Data Networking of Things"

Added the Tango examples to a Unity project so I could try them out and compare... so helpful!
Learning how this all works... want to know more about motion tracking and object recongition.
Fixed the camera issues, it displays properly now.
(Also the examples have the internet access permission set to "require" instead of the default "auto")

Looked up how to play video on objects in Unity.
Before 5.6 Movie Texture was used but this was only available in the pro version.
From 5.6 up, the Video Player component is used and is available in the personal version.
Will test this out tomorrow.

Tested playing a video on an object. It plays the video but doesn't play the audio.
Maybe my sample video was not the right format?
	https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/correct-video-format-for-video-playback.446011/#post-2887083
Says mp4 should work...
Kind of works by adding the audio separately and having the video and audio play together.
Not very elegant. Will try VideoPlayer with more formats mentioned in the link.

Made an app the combines the elements of all the tutorials that I've done so far.
Can use the camera to place objects in the world that play video.
Want to implement clicking the objects again to make them go away.
Also want next to try to incorporate some motion tracking and object recongition.
Need more tutorials for this^
